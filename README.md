## 🔧 How It Works

### AI Models Used

- **CLIP**: LAION ViT-H/14 (986M parameters) for high-accuracy image-text embeddings
- **YOLO**: YOLOv8x (68M parameters) for professional object detection (80 categories)
- **Face Detection**: InsightFace Buffalo_L with age/gender analysis and demographics
- **Clustering**: DBSCAN for face grouping and person identification
- **Relationship Intelligence**: NetworkX graph analysis with temporal event clustering

### Search Process

1. **Indexing**: Extract 1024-dimensional CLIP embeddings for each photo
2. **Object Detection**: Identify objects using YOLO (person, car, etc.)
3. **Face Detection**: Find and encode faces in photos with clustering
4. **Relationship Analysis**: Build co-occurrence graphs and infer relationships
5. **Storage**: Save embeddings, metadata, and relationships in SQLite database
6. **Search**: Convert text query to embedding, find similar photos with relationship context
7. **Ranking**: Sort results by combined similarity and relationship relevance

### 🤖 Relationship Intelligence

The system uses advanced graph analysis to understand relationships:

1. **Co-occurrence Analysis**: Tracks how often people appear together in photos
2. **Event Clustering**: Groups photos by time (48-hour windows) to understand context
3. **Relationship Inference**: Uses heuristics to classify relationships:
   - **Family**: 90% confidence for high co-occurrence across multiple events
   - **Close Friends**: 70% confidence for moderate co-occurrence
   - **Acquaintances**: 60-70% confidence for lower thresholds
4. **Group Management**: Organize people into custom groups for easy searching
